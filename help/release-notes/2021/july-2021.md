Updates to existing features in Adobe Experience Platform:

- [Data Science Workspace](#dsw)
- [Experience Data Model (XDM)](#xdm)

## Data Science Workspace {#dsw}

Data Science Workspace uses machine learning and artificial intelligence to create insights from your data. Integrated into Adobe Experience Platform, Data Science Workspace helps you make predictions using your content and data assets across Adobe solutions.

**New features**

| Feature | Description |

| Library and OS updates | Data Science Workspace has made significant library and OS updates to improve functionality and usability. This includes JupyterLab 1.2.20, Python 3.7, Pandas 1.2.4, Tensorflow 2.4.1 with CUDA 11 and CUDNN 8 support, and more. To learn how to view the available libraries within JupyterLab, visit the [supported libraries](../../data-science-workspace/jupyterlab/overview.md#supported-libraries) section in the JupyterLab notebooks overview documentation. |

## Experience Data Model (XDM) {#xdm}

Experience Data Model (XDM) is an open-source specification that is designed to improve the power of digital experiences. It provides common structures and definitions for data in the form of schemas, which allow any application to communicate with Platform services.

**New features**

| Feature | Description |

| Telecommunications industry filter | When adding field groups to a schema in the UI, you can now filter by the telecommunications industry. See the [telecommunications industry entity relationship diagram (ERD)](../../xdm/schema/industries/telecom.md) to see a recommended data model for telecom use cases. |
