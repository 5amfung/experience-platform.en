# Adobe Experience Platform release notes 

**Release date: June 30, 2021**

Updates to existing features in Adobe Experience Platform:

- [Real-time Customer Profile](#profile)

## Real-time Customer Profile {#profile}

Adobe Experience Platform enables you to drive coordinated, consistent, and relevant experiences for your customers no matter where or when they interact with your brand. With Real-time Customer Profile, you can see a holistic view of each individual customer that combines data from multiple channels, including online, offline, CRM, and third party data. [!DNL Profile] allows you to consolidate customer data into a unified view offering an actionable, timestamped account of every customer interaction.

| Feature | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
|Merge policy workflow updates| When creating and updating merge policies in the UI, users can now preview 20 sample profiles based on the union schema. This allows users to preview what customer profiles will look like before saving merge policy configurations. For more information, see the [merge policies UI guide](../../profile/merge-policies/ui-guide.md).|
|Identity overlap report| The identity overlap report is part of the Real-time Customer Profile API and provides visibility into the composition of the Profile store. Using the `/previewsamplestatus` endpoint, the identity overlap report exposes the identities that contribute most to addressable audience. To learn more, visit the [preview sample status API endpoint guide](../../profile/api/preview-sample-status.md).|
