# [!DNL Observability] notifications overview

[!DNL Observability Insights] allows you to subscribe to event notifications regarding Adobe Experience Platform activities. They reduce or eliminate the need to poll the [[!DNL Observability Insights] API](../api/overview.md) in order to check if a job has completed or if a certain milestone within a workflow has been reached.

[!DNL Observability] notifications currently leverage Adobe I/O Events, which can be sent to a configured webhook to facilitate efficient automation of activity monitoring. However, notification capabilities will eventually encompass email and UI notifications as well.

To get started with [!DNL Observability] notifications, continue to the tutorial on [subscribing to I/O Event notifications](./subscribe.md).
