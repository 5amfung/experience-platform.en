# Create a [!DNL Microsoft Dynamics] source connection using the [!DNL Flow Service] API

[!DNL Flow Service] is used to collect and centralize customer data from various disparate sources within Adobe Experience Platform. The service provides a user interface and RESTful API from which all supported sources are connectable.

This tutorial uses the [!DNL Flow Service] API to walk you through the steps to connect Platform to a [!DNL Microsoft Dynamics] (hereinafter referred to as "Dynamics") account using the Flow Service API.

## Getting started

This guide requires a working understanding of the following components of Adobe Experience Platform:

* [Sources](../../../../home.md): Experience Platform allows data to be ingested from various sources while providing you with the ability to structure, label, and enhance incoming data using Platform services.
* [Sandboxes](../../../../../sandboxes/home.md): Experience Platform provides virtual sandboxes which partition a single Platform instance into separate virtual environments to help develop and evolve digital experience applications.

The following sections provide additional information that you will need to know in order to successfully connect Platform to a Dynamics account using the [!DNL Flow Service] API.

### Gather required credentials

In order for [!DNL Flow Service] to connect to [!DNL Dynamics], you must provide values for the following connection properties:

| Credential | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| `serviceUri` | The service URL of your [!DNL Dynamics] instance. |
| `username` | The user name for your [!DNL Dynamics] user account. |
| `password` | The password for your [!DNL Dynamics] account. |
| `servicePrincipalId` | The client ID of your [!DNL Dynamics] account. This ID is required when using service principal and key-based authentication. |
| `servicePrincipalKey` | The service principal secret key. This credential is required when using service principal and key-based authentication. |

For more information on getting started, visit [this [!DNL Dynamics] document](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/developer/common-data-service/authenticate-oauth).

### Reading sample API calls

This tutorial provides example API calls to demonstrate how to format your requests. These include paths, required headers, and properly formatted request payloads. Sample JSON returned in API responses is also provided. For information on the conventions used in documentation for sample API calls, see the section on [how to read example API calls](../../../../../landing/troubleshooting.md#how-do-i-format-an-api-request) in the Experience Platform troubleshooting guide.

### Gather values for required headers

In order to make calls to Platform APIs, you must first complete the [authentication tutorial](https://www.adobe.com/go/platform-api-authentication-en). Completing the authentication tutorial provides the values for each of the required headers in all Experience Platform API calls, as shown below:

* `Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}`
* `x-api-key: {API_KEY}`
* `x-gw-ims-org-id: {IMS_ORG}`

All resources in Experience Platform, including those belonging to [!DNL Flow Service], are isolated to specific virtual sandboxes. All requests to Platform APIs require a header that specifies the name of the sandbox the operation will take place in:

* `x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}`

All requests that contain a payload (POST, PUT, PATCH) require an additional media type header:

* `Content-Type: application/json`

## Create a connection

A connection specifies a source and contains your credentials for that source. Only one connection is required per [!DNL Dynamics] account as it can be used to create multiple dataflows to bring in different data.

### Create a [!DNL Dynamics] connection using basic authentication

To create a [!DNL Dynamics] connection using basic authentication, make a POST request to the [!DNL Flow Service] API while providing values for your connection's `serviceUri`, `username`, and `password`.

**API format**

```http
POST /connections
```

**Request**

In order to create a [!DNL Dynamics] connection, its unique connection specification ID must be provided as part of the POST request. The connection specification ID for [!DNL Dynamics] is `38ad80fe-8b06-4938-94f4-d4ee80266b07`.

```shell
curl -X POST \
    'https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/flowservice/connections' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
    -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
    -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {IMS_ORG}' \
    -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
        "name": "Dynamics connection",
        "description": "Dynamics connection using basic auth",
        "auth": {
            "specName": "Basic Authentication for Dynamics-Online",
            "params": {
                "serviceUri": "{SERVICE_URI}",
                "username": "{USERNAME}",
                "password": "{PASSWORD}"
            }
        },
        "connectionSpec": {
            "id": "38ad80fe-8b06-4938-94f4-d4ee80266b07",
            "version": "1.0"
        }
    }'
```

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `auth.params.serviceUri` | The service URI associated with your [!DNL Dynamics] instance. |
| `auth.params.username` | The username associated with your [!DNL Dynamics] account. |
| `auth.params.password` | The password associated with your [!DNL Dynamics] account. |
| `connectionSpec.id` | The connection specification `id` of your [!DNL Dynamics] account retrieved in the previous step. |

**Response**

A successful response returns the newly created connection, including its unique identifier (`id`). This ID is required to explore your CRM system in the next step.

```json
{
    "id": "4cb0c374-d3bb-4557-b139-5712880adc55",
    "etag": "\"9e0052a2-0000-0200-0000-5e35tb330000\""
}
```

### Create a [!DNL Dynamics] connection using service principal key-based authentication

To create a [!DNL Dynamics] connection using service principal key-based authentication, make a POST request to the [!DNL Flow Service] API while providing values for your connection's `serviceUri`, `servicePrincipalId`, and `servicePrincipalKey`.

**API format**

```http
POST /connections
```

**Request**

```shell
curl -X POST \
    'https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/flowservice/connections' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
    -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
    -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {IMS_ORG}' \
    -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
        "name": "Dynamics connection",
        "description": "Dynamics connection using key-based authentication",
        "auth": {

                "servicePrincipalKey": "{SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_KEY}"
            }
        },
        "connectionSpec": {
            "id": "38ad80fe-8b06-4938-94f4-d4ee80266b07",
            "version": "1.0"
        }
    }'
```
