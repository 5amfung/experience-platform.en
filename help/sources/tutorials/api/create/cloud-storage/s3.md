# Create an [!DNL Amazon] S3 source connection using the [!DNL Flow Service] API

[!DNL Flow Service] is used to collect and centralize customer data from various disparate sources within Adobe Experience Platform. The service provides a user interface and RESTful API from which all supported sources are connectable.

This tutorial uses the [!DNL Flow Service] API to walk you through the steps to connect [!DNL Experience Platform] to an [!DNL Amazon] S3 (hereinafter referred to as "S3") storage.

If you would prefer to use the user interface in [!DNL Experience Platform], the [Amazon S3 source connector UI tutorial](../../../ui/create/cloud-storage/s3.md) provides step-by-step instructions for performing similar actions.

## Getting started

This guide requires a working understanding of the following components of Adobe Experience Platform:

* [Sources](../../../../home.md): [!DNL Experience Platform] allows data to be ingested from various sources while providing you with the ability to structure, label, and enhance incoming data using [!DNL Platform] services.
* [Sandboxes](../../../../../sandboxes/home.md): [!DNL Experience Platform] provides virtual sandboxes which partition a single [!DNL Platform] instance into separate virtual environments to help develop and evolve digital experience applications.

The following sections provide additional information that you will need to know in order to successfully connect to an S3 storage using the [!DNL Flow Service] API.

### Gather required credentials

In order for [!DNL Flow Service] to connect with your S3 storage, you must provide values for the following connection properties:

| Credential | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| `s3AccessKey` | The access key ID for your S3 storage. |
| `s3SecretKey` | The secret key ID for your S3 storage. |

For more information on getting started, visit [this AWS document](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/wheres-my-secret-access-key/).

### Reading sample API calls

This tutorial provides example API calls to demonstrate how to format your requests. These include paths, required headers, and properly formatted request payloads. Sample JSON returned in API responses is also provided. For information on the conventions used in documentation for sample API calls, see the section on [how to read example API calls](../../../../../landing/troubleshooting.md#how-do-i-format-an-api-request) in the [!DNL Experience Platform] troubleshooting guide.

### Gather values for required headers

In order to make calls to [!DNL Platform] APIs, you must first complete the [authentication tutorial](https://www.adobe.com/go/platform-api-authentication-en). Completing the authentication tutorial provides the values for each of the required headers in all [!DNL Experience Platform] API calls, as shown below:

* `Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}`
* `x-api-key: {API_KEY}`
* `x-gw-ims-org-id: {IMS_ORG}`

All resources in [!DNL Experience Platform], including those belonging to [!DNL Flow Service], are isolated to specific virtual sandboxes. All requests to [!DNL Platform] APIs require a header that specifies the name of the sandbox the operation will take place in:

* `x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}`

All requests that contain a payload (POST, PUT, PATCH) require an additional media type header:

* `Content-Type: application/json`

## Create a connection

A connection specifies a source and contains your credentials for that source. Only one connection is required per S3 account as it can be used to create multiple source connectors to bring in different data.

**API format**

```http
POST /connections
```

**Request**

In order to create an S3 connection, its unique connection specification ID must be provided as part of the POST request. The connection specification ID for S3 is `ecadc60c-7455-4d87-84dc-2a0e293d997b`.

```shell
curl -X POST \
    'https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/flowservice/connections' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
    -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
    -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {IMS_ORG}' \
    -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
        "name": "S3 Connection",
        "description": "Connection for an Amazon S3 account",
        "auth": {
            "specName": "Access Key",
            "params": {
                "s3AccessKey": "{S3_ACCESS_KEY}",
                "s3SecretKey": "{S3_SECRET_KEY}"
            }
        },
        "connectionSpec": {
            "id": "ecadc60c-7455-4d87-84dc-2a0e293d997b",
            "version": "1.0"
        }
    }'
```

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `auth.params.s3AccessKey` | The access key associated with your S3 storage. |
| `auth.params.s3SecretKey` | Your secret key associated with your S3 storage. |
| `connectionSpec.id` | The S3 storage connection specification ID: `ecadc60c-7455-4d87-84dc-2a0e293d997b` |

**Response**

A successful response returns details of the newly created connection, including its unique identifier (`id`). This ID is required to explore your storage in the next tutorial.

```json
{
    "id": "4cb0c374-d3bb-4557-b139-5712880adc55",
    "etag": "\"1700d77b-0000-0200-0000-5e3b41a10000\""
}
```

## Next steps

By following this tutorial, you have created an S3 connection using APIs and a unique ID was obtained as part of the response body. You can use this connection ID to [explore cloud storages using the Flow Service API](../../explore/cloud-storage.md) or [ingest Parquet data using the Flow Service API](../../cloud-storage-parquet.md).
