# (Beta) [!DNL GreenPlum] connector

>[!NOTE]
>
>The [!DNL GreenPlum] connector is in beta. See the [Sources overview](../../home.md#terms-and-conditions) for more information on using beta-labelled connectors.

Adobe Experience Platform provides native connectivity for database providers like [!DNL Microsoft], MySQL, and [!DNL Azure]. You can bring your data from these systems into [!DNL Platform].

Different types of third-party databases are supported, including relational, NoSQL, or data warehouses. Support for database providers includes [!DNL GreenPlum].

## IP address allow list

A list of IP addresses must be added to an allow list prior to working with source connectors. Failing to add your region-specific IP addresses to your allow list may lead to errors or non-performance when using sources. See the [IP address allow list](../../ip-address-allow-list.md) page for more information.
