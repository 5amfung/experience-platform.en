Click **[!UICONTROL Create destination]**. Your destination is now created. You can click [!UICONTROL Save & Exit] if you want to activate segments later on, or you can click [!UICONTROL Next] to continue the workflow and select segments to activate. In either case, see the next section, [Activate Segments](#activate-segments), for the rest of the workflow.

## Activate segments {#activate-segments}

See [Activate profiles and segments to a destination](../../ui/activate-destinations.md#select-attributes) for information about the segment activation workflow.

In the [Segment schedule](../../ui/activate-destinations.md#segment-schedule) step, you must manually map your segments to their corresponding ID or friendly name in the destination.

When mapping segments, we recommend you use the [!DNL Platform] segment name or a shorter form of it, for ease of use. However, the segment ID or name in your destination does not need to match the one in your [!DNL Platform] account. Any value you insert in the mapping field will be reflected by the destination.
