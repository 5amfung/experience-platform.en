# (Beta) [!DNL Amazon Kinesis] connection

## Overview {#overview}

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>The [!DNL Amazon Kinesis] destination in Platform is currently in beta. The documentation and the functionality are subject to change.

The [!DNL Kinesis Data Streams] service by [!DNL Amazon Web Services] allows you to collect and process large streams of data records in real time. 

You can create a real-time outbound connection to your [!DNL Amazon Kinesis] storage to stream data from Adobe Experience Platform. 

* For more information about [!DNL Amazon Kinesis], see the [Amazon documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/introduction.html).
* To connect to [!DNL Amazon Kinesis] programmatically, see the [Streaming destinations API tutorial](../../api/streaming-destinations.md).
* To connect to [!DNL Amazon Kinesis] using the Platform user interface, see the sections below.

## Use Cases {#use-cases}

By using streaming destinations such as [!DNL Amazon Kinesis], you can easily feed high-value segmentation events and associated profile attributes into your systems of choice.

For example, a prospect downloaded a white-paper which qualifies them into a "high-propensity to convert" segment. By mapping the segment that the prospect falls in to the [!DNL Amazon Kinesis] destination, you would receive this event in [!DNL Amazon Kinesis]. There, you can employ a do-it-yourself approach and describe business logic on top of the event, as you think would work best with your enterprise IT systems.

## Export Type {#export-type}

**Profile-based** - you are exporting all members of a segment, together with the desired schema fields (for example: email address, phone number, last name), as chosen from the select attributes screen of the [destination activation workflow](../../ui/activate-destinations.md#select-attributes).

## Connect destination {#connect-destination}

See [Cloud storage destinations workflow ](./workflow.md)for instructions on how to connect to your cloud storage destinations, including those supported by [!DNL Amazon]. 

For [!DNL Amazon Kinesis] destinations, enter the following information in the create destination workflow:

## Account step {#account-step}

* **[!DNL Amazon Web Services] access key and secret key**: In [!DNL Amazon Web Services], generate an `access key - secret access key` pair to grant Platform access to your [!DNL Amazon Kinesis] account. Learn more in the [Amazon Web Services documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html).
* **region**: Indicate which [!DNL Amazon Web Services] region to stream data to.

![Input fields in the account step](../../assets/catalog/cloud-storage/amazon-kinesis/account.png)

## Authentication step {#authentication-step}

* **Name**: Provide a name for your connection to [!DNL Amazon Kinesis]
* **Description**: Provide a description for your connection to [!DNL Amazon Kinesis].
* **stream**: Provide the name of an existing data stream in your [!DNL Amazon Kinesis] account. Platform will export data to this stream.
* **[!UICONTROL Marketing actions]**: Marketing actions indicate the intent for which data will be exported to the destination. You can select from Adobe-defined marketing actions or you can create your own marketing action. For more information about marketing actions, see the [Data Governance in Adobe Experience Platform](../../../data-governance/policies/overview.md) page. For information about the individual Adobe-defined marketing actions, see the [Data usage policies overview](../../../data-governance/policies/overview.md).

## Activate segments {#activate-segments}

See [Activate profiles and segments to a destination](../../ui/activate-destinations.md) for information about the segment activation workflow.

## Exported data {#exported-data}

Your exported [!DNL Experience Platform] data lands in [!DNL Amazon Kinesis] in JSON format. For example, the event below contains the email address profile attribute of an audience that has qualified for a certain segment and exited another segment. The identities for this prospect are ECID and email.

```json

  "person": {
    "email": "yourstruly@adobe.con"
