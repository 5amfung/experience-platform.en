# [!DNL Amazon S3] destination

## Overview

Create a live outbound connection to your [!DNL Amazon Web Services] (AWS) S3 storage to periodically export tab-delimited or CSV data files from Adobe Experience Platform into your own S3 buckets.

## Export Type {#export-type}

**Profile-based** - you are exporting all members of a segment, together with the desired schema fields (for example: email address, phone number, last name), as chosen from the select attributes screen of the [destination activation workflow](../../ui/activate-destinations.md#select-attributes).

## Connect destination {#connect-destination}

See [Cloud storage destinations workflow ](./workflow.md) for instructions on how to connect to your cloud storage destinations, including [!DNL Amazon S3]. 

For [!DNL Amazon S3] destinations, enter the following information in the create destination workflow:

* **[!DNL Amazon S3] access key and [!DNL Amazon S3] secret key**: In [!DNL Amazon S3], generate an `access key - secret access key` pair to grant Platform access to your [!DNL Amazon S3] account. Learn more in the [Amazon Web Services documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html).

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Platform needs `write` permissions on the bucket object where the export files will be delivered.

## Exported data {#exported-data}

For [!DNL Amazon S3] destinations, Platform creates a tab-delimited `.txt` or `.csv` file in the storage location that you provided. For more information about the files, see [Email Marketing destinations and Cloud storage destinations](../../ui/activate-destinations.md#esp-and-cloud-storage) in the segment activation tutorial.
