# Destinations workspace {#destinations-workspace}

In Adobe Experience Platform, select **[!UICONTROL Destinations]** from the left navigation bar to access the [!UICONTROL Destinations] workspace.

The [!UICONTROL Destinations] workspace consists of four sections, [!UICONTROL Catalog], [!UICONTROL Browse], [!UICONTROL Accounts], and [!UICONTROL System View], which are described in the sections below.

## [!UICONTROL Catalog] {#catalog}

The **[!UICONTROL Catalog]** tab displays a list of all destinations available in Platform, that you can send data to. 

The Platform user interface provides a number of search and filter options on the destinations catalog page:

* Use the search functionality on the page to locate a specific destination.
* Filter destinations using the [!UICONTROL Categories] control.
* Toggle between [!UICONTROL All destinations] and [!UICONTROL My destinations]. When **[!UICONTROL All destinations]** is selected, all available Platform destinations are displayed. When **[!UICONTROL My destinations]** is selected, you can only see the destinations with which you have established a connection.
* Select to view **[!UICONTROL Connections]** and/or **[!UICONTROL Extensions]**. To understand the difference between the two categories, see [Destination Types and Categories](../destination-types.md).

![destinations filtering and search demo](../assets/ui/workspace/destinations-search-and-filter.gif)

The destination cards contain either a **[!UICONTROL Configure]** or an **[!UICONTROL Activate]** control, and a secondary control that brings up more options. These are all described below:
