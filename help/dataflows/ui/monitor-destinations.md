# Monitor dataflows for destinations in the UI

Destinations allow you to activate your data from Adobe Experience Platform to countless external partners. This tutorial provides instructions on how you can monitor dataflows for your destinations using the Experience Platform user interface.

## Getting started

This tutorial requires a working understanding of the following components of Adobe Experience Platform:

- [Destinations](../../destinations/home.md): Destinations are pre-built integrations with commonly used applications that allow for the seamless activation of data from Platform for cross-channel marketing campaigns, email campaigns, targeted advertising, and many other use cases.
- [Sandboxes](../../sandboxes/home.md): [!DNL Experience Platform] provides virtual sandboxes which partition a single [!DNL Platform] instance into separate virtual environments to help develop and evolve digital experience applications.

## Monitor dataflows

In the **[!UICONTROL Destinations]** workspace within the Platform UI, navigate to the **[!UICONTROL Browse]** tab and select the name of a destination that you want to view.

A list of existing dataflows appears. On this page is a list of viewable dataflows, including information about their destination, username, number of dataflows, and status.

See the following table for more information on statuses:

| Status | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Enabled | The `Enabled` status indicates that a dataflow is active and is ingesting data according to the schedule it was provided. |
| Disabled | The `Disabled` status indicates that a dataflow is inactive and is not ingesting any data. |
| Processing | The `Processing` status indicates that a dataflow is not yet active. This status is often encountered immediately after a new dataflow is created. |
| Error | The `Error` status indicates that the activation process of a dataflow has been disrupted. |

## [!UICONTROL Dataflow runs]

The [!UICONTROL Dataflow runs] tab provides metric data on your dataflow runs to batch destinations. A list of individual runs and their particular metrics is displayed, along with the following totals for profile records:

- **[!UICONTROL Profile records activated]**: The total count of profile records that were created or updated for activation.
- **[!UICONTROL Profile records skipped]**:  The total count of profile records that are skipped for activation based on profile exits or missing attributes.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Dataflow runs are generated based on the destination dataflow's schedule frequency. A separate dataflow run is made for each merge policy applied to a segment.

To view the details of a particular dataflow run, select the run's start time from the list. The details page for a dataflow run contains additional information such as the size of data processed and a list of any errors that occurred with details for error diagnostics.
