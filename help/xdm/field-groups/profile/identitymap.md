# [!UICONTROL IdentityMap] schema field group

>[!NOTE]
>
>The names of several schema field groups have changed. See the document on [field group name updates](../name-updates.md) for more information.

[!UICONTROL IdentityMap] is a standard schema field group for the [[!DNL XDM Individual Profile] class](../../classes/individual-profile.md). The field group provides a single map field, which contains a set of user identities keyed by namespace.

>[!WARNING]
>
>The `IdentityMap` field is automatically updated by the system as identity data is ingested. In order to properly utilize this field for [Real-time Customer Profile](../../../profile/home.md), do not attempt to manually update the field's contents in your data operations.
