# Date functions

Data Prep supports date functions, both as strings and as datetime objects.

## Date function conversions

When string fields from incoming data are mapped to date fields in schemas using Experience Data Model (XDM), the date format should be explicitly mentioned. If not explicitly mentioned, Data Prep will attempt to convert the input data by matching it to the following formats. Once a matching format is found, it wil stop evaluating any subsequent formats.

```console
"yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ssZ",
"yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSSZ",
"yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS",
"yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSX",
"yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss'Z'",
"yyyy-MM-dd",
"yyyy/MM/dd",
"yyyy.MM.dd",
"yyyy-MMM-dd",
"yyyyMMdd",
"MM-dd-yyyy",
"MMddyyyy",
"M/dd/yyyy",
"dd.M.yyyy",
"M/dd/yyyy hh:mm:ss a",
"dd.M.yyyy hh:mm:ss a",
"dd.MMM.yyyy",
"dd-MMM-yyyy"
```

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
> Data Prep will try to convert strings to dates as best as possible. However, these conversions can lead to undesirable results. For example, the string value "12112020" matches the pattern "MMddyyyy", but the user may have intended for the date to be read with the pattern "ddMMyyyy". As a result, users should explicitly mention the date format for strings.

## Date/time format strings

The following table shows which pattern letters are defined for format strings. Please note that the letters are case sensitive.

**Example**

The expression `date(orderDate, "yyyy-MM-dd")` will convert an `orderDate` value of "December 31st, 2020" into a datetime value of "2020-12-31".
