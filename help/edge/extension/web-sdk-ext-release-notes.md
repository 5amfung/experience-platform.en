# Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK extension release notes

This document covers the release notes for the Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK extension for Adobe Experience Platform Launch. For the latest release notes on the SDK itself, see the [Platform Web SDK release notes](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/edge/release-notes.html).

## June 1, 2021

### Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK 2.5.0

Contains version 2.5.0 of the Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK library.

* Added a `data` field to the Send Event action. Upcoming documentation will describe how this can be used in certain scenarios.
* On the XDM Object data element view, an issue was fixed where an error was thrown if the user had access to Adobe Experience Platform sandboxes but not to the sandbox configured as the default for the organization.
* On the XDM Object data element view, an issue was fixed where a required schema field would be considered invalid even if the parent object contained no values.

## March 9, 2021

### Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK 2.4.0

Contains version 2.4.0 of the Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK library.

* Added ["document unloading"](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/edge/fundamentals/tracking-events.html?lang=en#using-the-sendbeacon-api) checkbox to Send Event action UI.
* Added support for an `out` option when [configuring default consent](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/edge/fundamentals/configuring-the-sdk.html#default-consent) which drops all events until consent is received (the existing `pending` option queues events and sends them once consent is received).
* Added a tooltip to the default consent field.
* Added support for [Adobe's Consent 2.0 standard](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/edge/consent/supporting-consent.html?communicating-consent-preferences-via-the-adobe-standard).
* A better error now displays in the XDM Object data element UI if the user's access token is invalid or improperly provisioned.
* Fixed a cross-origin error (which does not affect the operation of the extension) that showed up on the browser developer console when viewing an XDM Object data element.

## November 4, 2020

### Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK 2.3.0

Contains version 2.3.0 of the Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK library.

#### Features

* Added support for using a data element when configuring default consent.
* Added ability to search for XDM schemas with the XDM Object data element type.
* Added cloning of XDM data within the Send Event action type to ensure any subsequent changes to the XDM data object will not be reflected in the request.

## October 1, 2020

### Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK 2.2.0

#### Bug Fixes

* When customers tried to create an XDM object from sandbox schemas, they were running into authentication issues. The API that calls Platform is now aware of environments so users are only presented with those schemas that they have access to edit. 

#### Features

* When using the `identityMap` data element, the namespaces is now pre-populated in a dropwdown so you don't have to fill this in manually. 
* Revamped the UI for the `xdmObject` data element. In the new UI, you can see which fields have been populated without having to enter each item in the object.


## August 26, 2020

### Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK 2.1.1

#### Features

* Fixes an issue where Adobe Experience Platform sandboxes on the XDM Object view displayed incorrectly. If, when using this version of the extension, an expected sandbox is not displayed in the list, the user should check with their Adobe Experience Platform administrator to ensure access permissions are set correctly.


## August 5, 2020

### Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK 2.1.0

#### Features

* Breaking Change: Remove the `syncIdentity` action and support passing those IDs in the `sendEvent` action instead. Please disable any existing rule using this action before upgrading your extension.
* Update to Alloy v. 2.1.0 ([Release Notes](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/edge/release-notes.html))
* Support IAB 2.0 Consent Standard in the `setConsent` action.
* Support overriding the dataset ID in the `sendEvent` action.
* Add a new Data Element of type `IdentityMap` which can be used to populate the `identityMap` entry in the XDM Object Data Element which is now enabled, and in the `setConsent` action.
* Support passing an identity map in the `setConsent` action.
* Support choosing an Platform sandbox in the XDM Object Data Element.


## May 26, 2020

## May 4, 2020

### Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK 0.1.2

#### Features

* Renamed `configId` to `edgeConfigId`.
* Renamed `viewStart` to `renderDecisions`, set to false by default. If set to true, Personalization offers are fetched and auto-rendered.
* Changes related to `Get Decisions`:
  * Removed the `getDecisions` command.
  * Added a `scopes` option to the `sendEvent` command. Decisions are returned in the `sendEvent` resolved promise.
  * Added a built-in `__view__` scope which will result in returning page/view wide offers. (VEC offers in Target for example.)
Those decisions return from the `sendEvent` command only if `renderDecisions` is set to false.
  * Added a `Decisions Received` event, which fires when decisions become available. 
* Combined multiple Personalization notifications under a single server call.
* Fixed issue in Event Merge ID where it was being reset every time the data element was referenced.
* Renamed the `setCustomerIds` action to `syncIdentity`.
* Added a `getIdentity` command. This can be consumed via custom code only for now.
* Enabling debug using `_satellite` now enables debugging in the Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK.
* Added support for typed values in the XDM Object: Booleans, Numbers and Decimals.
