# Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK extension overview

The Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK extension sends data to Adobe Experience Cloud from web properties through the Adobe Experience Platform Edge Network. The extension allows you to stream data into Platform, synchronize identities, process customer consent signals, and automatically collect context data.

This document covers how to configure the extension in the Adobe Experience Platform Launch user interface.

## Configure the extension

If the Platform Web SDK extension has already been installed for a property, open the property in the Platform Launch UI and select the **[!UICONTROL Extensions]** tab. Under the Platform Web SDK, select **[!UICONTROL Configure]**.

If you have not installed the extension yet, select the **[!UICONTROL Catalog]** tab. From the list of available extensions, find the Platform Web SDK extension and select **[!UICONTROL Install]**.

In both cases, you arrive at the configuration page for the Platform Web SDK. The sections below explain the extension's configuration options.

## General configuration options

The configuration options at the top of the page tell Adobe Experience Platform where to route the data and what configurations to use on the server.

### [!UICONTROL Name]

The Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK extension supports multiple instances on the page. The name is used to send data to multiple organizations with a single Platform Launch configuration.

The extension's name defaults to "[!DNL alloy]". However, you can change the instance name to any valid JavaScript object name.

### **[!UICONTROL IMS Organization ID]**

The [!UICONTROL IMS Organization ID] is the organization that you would like the data sent to at Adobe. Most of the time, use the default value that is autopopulated. When you have multiple instances on the page, populate this field with the value of the second organization you want to send data to.

### **[!UICONTROL Edge Domain]**

The [!UICONTROL Edge Domain] is the domain that the Adobe Experience Platform extension sends and receives data from. The extension requires that you use a 1st-party CNAME for production traffic. The default 3rd-party domain works for development environments but is not suitable for production environments. Instructions on how to set up a first-party CNAME are listed [here](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/core-services/interface/ec-cookies/cookies-first-party.html).

## [!UICONTROL Datastreams]

When a request is sent to the Adobe Experience Platform Edge Network, a datastream ID is used to reference the server-side configuration. You can update the configuration without having to make code changes on your website.

See the guide on [datastreams](../fundamentals/datastreams.md) for more information.


## [!UICONTROL Privacy]

The [!UICONTROL Privacy] section allows you to configure how the SDK handles user consent signals from your website. Specifically, it allows you to select the default level of consent that is assumed of a user if no other explicit consent preference has been provided. The default consent level is not saved to the user's profile. The following table breaks down what each option entails:

| [!UICONTROL Default Consent Level] | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [!UICONTROL In] | Collect events that occur before the user provides consent preferences. |
| [!UICONTROL Out] | Discard events that occur before the user provides consent preferences. |
| [!UICONTROL Pending] | Queue events that occur before the user provides consent preferences. When consent preferences are provided, the events will be collected or discarded depending on the provided preferences. |
| [!UICONTROL Provided by data element] | The default consent level is determined by a separate data element that you define. When using this option, you must specify the data element using the provided dropdown menu. |

Use Out or Pending if you require explicit user consent for your business operations.
