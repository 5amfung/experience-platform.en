## Version 2.3.0

* Added nonce support to allow for stricter content security policies.
* Added personalization support for single-page applications.
* Improved compatibility with other on-page JavaScript code that may be overwriting `window.console` APIs.
* Bug Fix: `sendBeacon` was not being used when `documentUnloading` was set to `true` or when link clicks were automatically tracked.
* Bug Fix: A link wouldn't be automatically tracked if the anchor element contained HTML content.
* Bug Fix: Certain browser errors containing a read-only `message` property were not handled appropriately, resulting in a different error being exposed to the customer.
* Bug Fix: Running the SDK within an iframe would result in an error if the iframe's HTML page was from a different subdomain than the parent window's HTML page. 

## Version 2.2.0

* Bug Fix: The Opt-in object was blocking Alloy from making calls when `idMigrationEnabled` is `true`.
