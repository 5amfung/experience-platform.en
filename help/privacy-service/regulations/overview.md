# Privacy regulations overview

This document provides an overview of the different privacy regulations supported by Adobe Experience Cloud.

Through the use of Adobe Experience Platform Privacy Service, Experience Cloud supports access and delete requests based on the following regulations:

| Regulation | Description |
| --- | --- |
| CCPA (California) | The [[!DNL California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)]](https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa) enhances privacy rights and consumer protection for residents of California, United States. The CCPA provides new data privacy rights to California residents, including the right to access and delete their personal data, to know whether their personal data is sold or disclosed (and to whom), and the right to opt out of having their data sold to third parties. |
| GDPR (European Union) | The [[!DNL General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)]](https://gdpr-info.eu) introduced several new data privacy rights for members of the European Union, including the Right to Access and the Right to be Forgotten. This means that any EU citizen whose personal data has been collected by your business can request to access or delete their data at any time. |
| LGPD (Brazil) | The [[!DNL Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados (LGPD)]](https://gdpr.eu/gdpr-vs-lgpd/) aims to regulate the treatment of personal data of all individuals or natural persons in Brazil. The LGPD gives Brazil citizens the rights to access and delete their personal data, to know whether their personal data is sold or disclosed (and to whom), and the right to opt out of having their data sold to third parties. |
| PDPA (Thailand) | The [[!DNL Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA)]](https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/Overview-of-PDPA/The-Legislation/Personal-Data-Protection-Act) was introduced to safeguard Thai data owners from the illegal collection, use, or disclosure of their personal data. Inspired by the European Union's GDPR, the regulation grants Thai citizens the right to request access to, or the deletion of, their stored personal data. |
